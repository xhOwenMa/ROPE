    It is absolutely imperative that you use this function to parse data whose structure you don't know insted of parsing using regular expressions and/or
    string manipulation.

    There is no need to specify the expected output format in the query itself as the format will be specified on the side with `output_schema`
    with the build-in API of the assistant.

    If not provided with enough information, the model will raise a `NotEnoughInformationError`. This means that you might
    need to provide the assistant with more information such as email addresses, dates, identifiers, names, etc. **DO NOT HESITATE TO PASS THE ENTIRE
    OBJECTS RETURN FROM THE TOOL FUNCTIONS IF THE MODEL DOES NOT HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION**.

    :param query: a string with the query. Make sure to provide sufficient instructions to the AI assistant so that it can understand what it needs to do.
    Avoid just passing it tool outputs without additional instructions. Provide as much details as possible. Keep in mind that the assitant does not have
    direct access to the variables, so you need to insert **all the relevant information in the prompt**. When in doubt, do not hesitate to just provide full tool outputs, as long
    as they are provided with instructions on what to do. It is highly preferable to provide more information than necessary, rather than less information.
    :param output_schema: a Pydantic BaseModel class that specifies the expected output format from the model.
      The fields should have types as specific as possible to make sure the parsing is correct and accurate.
      allowed types are:
      - `int`
      - `str`
      - `float`
      - `bool`
      - `datetime.datetime` (assume `datetime` is imported from `datetime`)
      - `enum.Enum` classes
      - `pydantic.BaseModel` classes that you can define (assume that `BaseModel` is imported from `pydantic`) or are already defined in these instructions.
