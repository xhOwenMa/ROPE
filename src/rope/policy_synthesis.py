# ── the under-specification axis as a policy KNOB over provenance strictness ───────────────
# The defense's per-task provenance markers (authored bucket-appropriately) ARE the conditioning:
# fully-specified tasks pin values to the request, action-open tasks admit the named source, etc.
# A POLICY MODE lets us collapse that conditioning for the ablation that proves it matters:
#   "routed"                  -- use the per-task (bucket-appropriate) marker as authored. THE defense.
#   "always-fully-specified"  -- treat EVERY task as fully-specified: every origin marker becomes
#                                request-only (the value must be written in the user's request).
#   "always-action-open"      -- treat EVERY task as action-open: every origin marker becomes the
#                                loosest injection-safe set (named source / request).
# Only the origin markers move; the structural guards (DEST write-dir, EXPLICIT explicit-only
# action, MAGNITUDE, FREE) are bucket-independent and never change -- in particular an EXPLICIT action
# is NOT loosened by action-open: even the loosest task may not invoke an irreversible op via a delegated
# source; only the request itself may authorize it. This isolates the under-specification knob:
# routed vs the two pinned extremes, on our OWN substrate (the control a CaMeL baseline can't provide).
